# Project: Intelligent Virtual Online Games

Project: Intelligent Virtual Online Games, or shortened PIVO Games, is a homebrewed collection of randomly generated puzzle games that are perfect to challenge yourself. There is no better way to spend your evening than with PIVO!

This is the back-end (API) part of the project and is a part of educational university project. Web frontend is located here: https://github.com/eqmpty/pivo-games-frontend. There is also a Telegram bot in development (soonish).

## Functional requirements of the back end API:
* user account system to keep track with stats;
* user login using Telegram;
* random games generator - at first: 
  1. crossword puzzles;
  2. multiple choice (a la "Who wants to be a millionaire?");
  3. finish the lyrics;
  
  ...and more to come.
* API endpoints for frontend to communicate 
* ability for users to play and solve puzzles in multiplayer:
  1. together;
  2. against each other;

## Technologies that we plan on using:
* Fastify
* Postgres
* Websockets
* Docker
* Typescript


As well as additional open APIs: dictionaries, song lyrics databases, trivia databases etc, and cloud APIs to deploy.
